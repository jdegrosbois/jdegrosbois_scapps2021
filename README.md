## Estimating visual corrective reaction times in double-step paradigms using machine learning: A proof of principle

Code and Content from SCAPPS 2021 Presentation
A copy of the presentation in pdf form can be found in the root directory.
The task-specific scripts are in their own folders. Just copy the data into each folder and run the scripts sequentially.
This is done separately because each condition had its own quirks and specific trials that were screened.

## The associated data is publically available at:

## This represents a re-analysis of the data published by Moher & Song (2019) and uses a random forest classifier to estimate visual corrective reaction times in a double step paradigm.
